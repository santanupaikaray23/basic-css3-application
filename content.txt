CSS Units:
-------------
1. Absolute Units
a. Pixels (px)
b. Inches (in)
c. Centimeters(cm)
d. Millimeter(mm)
e. Points(pt)

2. Relative Units
a. Percentage(%)
b. Font-sizes(em & rem)
c. Charcter-size(ex & ch)
d. Viewport dimensions(vw & vh)
e. Viewport max(vmax)
f. Viewport maximum(vmax)

Relative Units are based on
-------------------------------
1. The parent dimensions(%)
2. The currently declared  font-Attributes(em, rem, ex, ch)
3. The Viewport dimensions(vh,vw,vmin,vmax)

Viewport : User's Visilbe area of the webpage 


ex -  Relative to the x-height of the current font

x-height is roughly the height of lower case letter

ch -  Relative to the width of "0" 1ch == 8px

em - Relative to the font-size of the parent element

rem - relative to the font-size of the root element

Note: In almost every browser 16px is the standard for font.

rem : User can control the font-size

1rem = 16 px;

vh - Viewport height
1vh - is equal to 1% of the current viewport height
vw - viewport width
1vw - is equal to 1 % of the current viewport width
vmin- Uses the ratio of smallest size. That is if the height of the browser
windows is less than it's width 1vmin will be equivalent of 1vh
vmax- Uses the ratio of largest size. so if 1vmax is equivalent to 1vw if viewport is wider 
than it is tall.If the browser is taller than it is wide 1max is equivalent to 1vh.

Absolute Units:
-----------------
The absolute units are fixed and length expressed in any of these exactly the same size.

1. Centimeter(cm)(1cm = 37.8px)
---------------------------------
use  for "Print" media type style sheet
2.Millimeter(mm)(1mm=0.1cm=3.78px)
----------------------------------------
1em == 16px ==0.17in == 12pt == 1pc == 4.2 mm == 0.42cm
-------------------------------------------------------------
Inches(in) (1in == 96px ==2.54cm)
-------------------------------------------
Incjes is same as Centimeter and will be use for "Print" media
Pixel (px)
---------------------
It is most usable and considered measure in browser.
